    <h1>Poems by Yulia </h1>

    <hr />
<h2>Poem 1: The Rookie Coder</h2>

In a world of ones and zeros, they dared to roam,<br />
The rookie coder, in their basement, found a home.<br />
With HTML and CSS, they took the first dive,<br />
But soon realized, it was harder than staying alive!<br />
<br />
They battled with bugs, like knights of old,<br />
Syntax errors and typos, their stories were told.<br />
Their friends said, "Just quit, it's not worth the strife,"<br />
But they laughed and replied, "I'll code for life!"<br />
<br />

<h2>Poem 2: The Code Confounder</h2>

In a land of divs and semicolons, they took a stand,<br />
The code confounder, with mouse in hand.<br />
They clicked and they clacked, with a puzzled frown,<br />
CSS made their brain spin 'round and 'round!<br />
<br />
JavaScript's quirks, like a mischievous elf,<br />
Made their code dance, all by itself.<br />
They sighed and they groaned, with each bug they met,<br />
But they knew in their heart, they'd get it yet!<br />
<br />

<h2>Poem 3: The Web Wizard Wannabe</h2>

In the realm of web dev, they aspired to reign,<br />
The web wizard wannabe, with a passion insane.<br />
They learned of frameworks and libraries galore,<br />
But React and Vue left them wanting more!<br />
<br />
They Googled and Googled, from dusk till dawn,<br />
For answers to problems that seemed to spawn.<br />
But despite all the hurdles, they stayed on track,<br />
For they knew that web dev was never a cakewalk!<br />

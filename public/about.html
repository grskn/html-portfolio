<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hey, i am Yulia. I'm a multi-passionate creative with a diverse background in photography, digital marketing, graphic design, and UI/UX design. I love exploring different creative fields and combining them to create unique solutions for my clients. In addition to my creative skills, I also have experience in administration and customer service.

<p>I enjoy interacting with people and always strive to provide the best possible experience for them.
  My passion for design and customer service led me to pursue a career in which I can combine both aspects. I believe that a great design should not only look good but also meet the needs of its users and enhance their experience.
